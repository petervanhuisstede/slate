# Practice: Program Structure

Having digested this simple C program it is time to learn some
Python. Using "points.c" as an example, write a working Python
program, "points.py" using the outline and the program structure we
used for "points.c".

## Exercise 1

Use your Python environment of choice (REPL, Spyder, Jupyter Notebook,
etc.). When your are done, sum up the main differences between the two
programs.

```python
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

## Exercise 2

The main differences between "points.c" and "points.py" are:

## Exercise 3

In C we compile a program usually from the CLI. Because these commands
can become unwieldly long, we often use a so-called Makefile (as you
have seen in the C tutorial) to compile a C program.

Below describe the way you wrote and run your Python program. If you
like you can present the actual CLI commands in the following snippet.

```shell
# YOUR CLI snippets here
```

## Exercise 4.1

What are the rules for names of variables in Python?

## Exercise 4.1

What are the reserved Python keywords you can't use as names of
variables?
