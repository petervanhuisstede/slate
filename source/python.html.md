# Practice: Program Structure

## Exercise 1

Having digested this simple C program it is time to learn some
Python. Using "points.c" as an example, write a working Python
program, "points.py" using the outline and the program structure we
used for "points.c".

```python
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

## Exercise 2

Use your Python environment of choice (REPL, Spyder, Jupyter Notebook,
etc.). When your are done, sum up the main differences between the two
programs.

The main differences between "points.c" and "points.py" are:

## Exercise 3

In C we compile a program usually from the CLI. Because these commands
can become unwieldly long, we often use a so-called Makefile (as you
have seen in the C tutorial) to compile a C program.

Below describe the way you wrote and ran your Python program. If you
like you can present the actual CLI commands in the following snippet.

```shell
# YOUR CLI snippets here
```

## Exercise 4

Describe the ways comments are done in Python

```python

```

## Exercise 9

What are the reserved Python keywords you can't use as names of
variables?

col 1 | col 2 | col 3 | col 4
----- | ----- | ----- | -----

How many are there? Compared to the number of reserved keywords in C
what does this number tell you?

## Exercise 10

Write a program in Python to determine the ranges of the types int and
float.
