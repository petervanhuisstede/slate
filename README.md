The idea is very simple: Use Slate to teach programming. Slate is used
to document the API's of programs. It has a two-pane view and can deal
with code snippets. It teams up with Github (public repositories). It
is Markdown text.

The main questions were:

- Can it be used for programming tutorials (self-study)?
- Can one combine the text with questions? Answers?

In order to explore these and other questions, we used the small
textbook "Introduction to C" by Delores M. Etter and transcribed it
into Slate.
